School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, tribal, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files contain school district information from the 1999-2000 school year.\n\nThe UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files identify three levels of school districts representing different grade ranges of the school-age population (elementary and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represent all grade levels. The elementary and secondary levels of a school district can overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, a secondary school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The TIGER/Line files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files contain a Unified School District code for those school districts where all grade levels are represented in a single district. The elementary and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code. An exception exists for the State of Hawaii and the five boroughs of New York city where the National School District Program requested that the U.S. Census Bureau include the School Complex Areas in Hawaii and the Community School Districts in New York city. In Massachusetts. South Carolina, and Tennessee some unified school districts also serve as secondary school districts in areas where there are elementary school districts. In these situations, the U.S. Census Bureau could not use the same school district code to identify school districts serving different grade ranges and has assigned two separate codes; a unified school district code and a separate \"false\" secondary school district code. Data users can identify the \"false\" school districts by looking for \"false\" as part of the school district name appearing in Record Type C. A few additional exceptions occur where the Department of Defense operates elementary schools within a unified school district.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files store the school district codes in a set of three, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 99999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.\n\nConsolidated City. \nAn incorporated place that has combined its governmental functions with a county or subcounty entity but contains one or more other incorporated places that continue to function as local governments within the consolidated government.\n\nIncorporated Place.\nA type of governmental unit, incorporated under state law as a city, town (except in New England, New York, and  Wisconsin), borough (except in Alaska and New York), or village, having legally prescribed limits, powers, and functions.",

The term, rail line in center, indicates that a rail line shares the road right-of-way. The rail line may follow the center of the road or be directly next to the road; representation is dependent upon the available source used during the update. The rail line can represent a railroad, a streetcar line, or other carline. Road types possibly represented here are defined as follows:\n\n-Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.\n-Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics.\n-Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways.\n-Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads.\n-Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in this category.\n-Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics.\n-Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state, based on entity boundaries established on January 1, 1990. \nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county (or statistical equivalent of a county), and are defined by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. \nCensus 2000 is the first decennial census for which the entire United States has census tracts. In 1990 some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts. Block groups and census blocks are uniquely numbered within census tract (except for Census 2000 collection blocks which were uniquely numbered within county).\nCensus tracts generally have a population size between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.\n\nBoundaries and Boundary Changes \nCensus tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. Census tract boundaries may follow legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries, in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries are al-ways census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, tribal census tracts are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous.\n\nCensus Tracts in American Indian Areas \nThe U.S. Census Bureau has reserved the census tract numbering range of 9400 to 9499 for use by American Indian area participants in situations where an American Indian entity crosses county or state boundaries. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, the U.S. Census Bureau will tabulate census tract data within federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands ignoring state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as tribal census tracts.",

School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, tribal, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files contain school district information from the 1999-2000 school year.\n\nThe UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files identify three levels of school districts representing different grade ranges of the school-age population (elementary and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represent all grade levels. The elementary and secondary levels of a school district can overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, a secondary school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The TIGER/Line files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files contain a Unified School District code for those school districts where all grade levels are represented in a single district. The elementary and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code. An exception exists for the State of Hawaii and the five boroughs of New York city where the National School District Program requested that the U.S. Census Bureau include the School Complex Areas in Hawaii and the Community School Districts in New York city. In Massachusetts. South Carolina, and Tennessee some unified school districts also serve as secondary school districts in areas where there are elementary school districts. In these situations, the U.S. Census Bureau could not use the same school district code to identify school districts serving different grade ranges and has assigned two separate codes; a unified school district code and a separate \"false\" secondary school district code. Data users can identify the \"false\" school districts by looking for \"false\" as part of the school district name appearing in Record Type C. A few additional exceptions occur where the Department of Defense operates elementary schools within a unified school district.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files store the school district codes in a set of three, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 99999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.\nThe predominant feature classes represented in this layer include: airports or airfields; cemeteries; fraternities or sororities; state or local parks or forests; golf courses; lookout towers; educational and religious institutions.  Other possible landmark features could include military installations, multi-household or transient quarters, custodial facilities, other types of transportation facilities or terminals, employment centers, open space and other special landmark designations for post offices, police stations and firehouses.\n\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration.\n\nA census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.\n\nLandmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) for the state. \n\nMSAs are Metropolitan Areas (MAs) that are not closely associated with other MAs. These areas typically are surrounded by non-metropolitan counties (county subdivisions in New England). There are three types of metropolitan areas. If a metropolitan area has a total population of less than 1,000,000, the area is designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan areas with a population of 1,000,000 or greater qualify for designation as a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that is composed of smaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs). This designation is not automatic; the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) solicits local opinion to designate CMSAs and their component PMSAs.\n\nPMSAs consist of a county or cluster of counties (cities and towns in New England) that demonstrate very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSAs are established, the larger MA of which they are component parts is designated a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA). CMSAs and PMSAs are established only where local governments favor such a designation for a large MA.\n\nMetropolitan Areas (MAs) are designated and defined by the OMB, following a set of official standards that are published in a Federal Register Notice. These standards were developed by the interagency Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MAs nationwide. The general concept of an MA is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a U.S. Census Bureau defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). An MA contains one or more central counties and may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county. An outlying county must have a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as population density, urban population, and population growth. In New England, MAs consist of cities and towns rather than whole counties. The territory, population, and housing units in MAs are referred to as \"metropolitan.\" The metropolitan category is subdivided into \"inside central city\" and \"outside central city.\" The territory, population, and housing units located outside MAs are referred to as \"non-metropolitan.\" The metropolitan and non-metropolitan classification cuts across the other hierarchies; for example, there is generally both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.\n\nStatistical entities which share some relation to the MSA include:\n\nCentral City\nIn each metropolitan statistical area and consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the largest place and, in some cases, one or more additional places are designated as ''central cities'' under the official standards. A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities, are included in the title of the metropolitan area (MA); there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nMetropolitan Area Central Cities\nsmaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities are included in the title of the MA; there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nNew England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs)\nNew England county metropolitan areas (NECMAs) are defined as a county-based alternative to the city and town based New England MSAs and CMSAs. The NECMA defined for an MSA or CMSA includes:\n- The county containing the first-named city in that MSA/CMSA title (this county may include the first-named cities of other MSAs/CMSAs as well.\n- Each additional county having at least half its population in the MSAs/CMSAs whose first-named cities are in the previously identified county.\nNECMAs are not identified for individual PMSAs. Only the CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs appear in the TIGER/Line files. The U.S. Census Bureau does not include NECMAs in the TIGER/Line files.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer depicts feature location and other associated data for American Indian tribal entities for those entities established on January 1, 2000. American Indian Reservations are areas that have been set aside by the United States for the use of tribes, the exterior boundaries of which are more particularly defined in the final tribal treaties, agreements, executive orders, federal statutes, secretarial orders, or judicial determinations.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau recognizes federal reservations as territory over which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. These entities are known as colonies, communities, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, villages, Indian communities, and Indian villages. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) maintains a list of federally recognized tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations. Federal reservations may cross state, county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The BIA supplied the U.S. Census Bureau with the names and exterior boundaries of the federal AIRs used for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for American Indian reservations in the 1970 census. The range of Census Codes allocated to Federal AIRs for the year 2000 data is 0001 to 4999.\nThere are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs), and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs). Tribal subdivisions can exist within the statistical Oklahoma tribal statistical areas.\nIn all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no American Indian, Alaska Native, or Hawaiian home land can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs). \n\nAmerican Indian Trust Lands\nAreas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off a reservation. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority over these lands. Primary tribal governmental authority generally is not attached to tribal lands located off the reservation until the lands are placed in trust. In U.S. Census Bureau data tabulations, off-reservation trust lands always are associated with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. A tribal government appointed liaison provides the name and boundaries of their trust lands. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), an agency in the U.S. Department of the Interior, identified and provided maps of these areas for use by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for off-reservation tribal trust lands in the 1980 census; in 1990, the trust land data included both tribal and individual trust lands. The U.S. Census Bureau does not identify fee land (or land in fee simple status) or restricted fee lands as specific geographic categories and they are not identified in the TIGER/Line files. Trust lands are assigned the same code as the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are assigned codes based on tribal name. In the TIGER/Line files, a letter code-\"T\" for tribal and \"I\" for individual-appears in a separate field and identifies off-reservation trust lands.\n\nAmerican Indian Reservations-State (State AIRs) \nReservations established by some state governments for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state recognized American Indian reservations to the U.S. Census Bureau. State reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to State AIRs for the year 2000 data is 9000 to 9499.\n\nAmerican Indian Tribal Subdivisions\nAdministrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust land, or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). Tribal subdivisions are known as areas, chapters, communities, or districts. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indians on the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or OTSAs. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in 1980 when it identified them as \"American Indian sub-reservation areas.\" The U.S. Census Bureau did not provide data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in conjunction with the 1990 census.\n\nJoint Use Areas\nAs applied to any American Indian area/Alaska Native area by the U.S. Census Bureau, means an area that is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The U.S. Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.\n\nState Designated American Indian Statistical Areas (SDAISAs)\nStatistical entities for state recognized American Indian tribes that do not have a state recognized land base (reservation). SDAISAs are identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by a state liaison identified by the governor's office in each state. SDAISAs generally encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of people who identify with a state recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A SDAISA may not be located in more than one state unless the tribe is recognized by both states, and it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), tribal designated statistical area (TDSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau established SDAISAs as a new geographic statistical area for Census 2000 to differentiate between state recognized tribes without a land base and federally recognized tribes without a land base. For the 1990 census, all such tribal entities had been identified as TDSAs. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to SDAISAs for the year 2000 data is 9500 to 9998.\n\nTribal Designated Statistical Areas (TDSAs)\nStatistical entities identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have a federally recognized land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A TDSA may be located in more than one state, but it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for TDSAs in conjunction with the 1990 census, when both federally and state recognized tribes could identify and delineate TDSAs. For Census 2000, TDSAs now apply only to federally recognized tribes. State recognized tribes without a land base, including those that were TDSAs in 1990, are identified as state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs), a new geographic entity for Census 2000. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to TDSAs for the year 2000 data is 8000 to 8999.\n\nTribal Jurisdiction Statistical Areas (TJSAs)\n1990 statistical entities identified and delineated for the 1990 census to provide a geographic frame of reference for the presentation of statistical data. 1990 TJSA boundaries were required to follow census block boundaries and were based upon the boundaries of the former reservations of federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma. TJSAs replaced the Historic Areas of Oklahoma recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1980 decennial census. The 1990 descriptive designation, TJSA, has been changed for Census 2000 to Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs).",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state, based on boundaries established on January 1, 2000. \nCensus tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county (or statistical equivalent of a county), and are defined by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. \nCensus 2000 is the first decennial census for which the entire United States has census tracts. In 1990 some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts. Block groups and census blocks are uniquely numbered within census tract (except for Census 2000 collection blocks which were uniquely numbered within county).\nCensus tracts generally have a population size between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.\n\nBoundaries and Boundary Changes \nCensus tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. Census tract boundaries may follow legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries, in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries are al-ways census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, tribal census tracts are defined within American Indian entities and can cross state and county boundaries. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of discontiguous areas. These discontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves discontiguous.\n\nCensus Tracts in American Indian Areas \nThe U.S. Census Bureau has reserved the census tract numbering range of 9400 to 9499 for use by American Indian area participants in situations where an American Indian entity crosses county or state boundaries. Under the Census 2000 American Indian/Alaska Native area/Hawaiian home land census geographic hierarchy, the U.S. Census Bureau will tabulate census tract data within federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands ignoring state and county boundaries. These are commonly referred to as tribal census tracts.",

School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, tribal, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files contain school district information from the 1999-2000 school year.\n\nThe UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files identify three levels of school districts representing different grade ranges of the school-age population (elementary and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represent all grade levels. The elementary and secondary levels of a school district can overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, a secondary school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The TIGER/Line files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files contain a Unified School District code for those school districts where all grade levels are represented in a single district. The elementary and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code. An exception exists for the State of Hawaii and the five boroughs of New York city where the National School District Program requested that the U.S. Census Bureau include the School Complex Areas in Hawaii and the Community School Districts in New York city. In Massachusetts. South Carolina, and Tennessee some unified school districts also serve as secondary school districts in areas where there are elementary school districts. In these situations, the U.S. Census Bureau could not use the same school district code to identify school districts serving different grade ranges and has assigned two separate codes; a unified school district code and a separate \"false\" secondary school district code. Data users can identify the \"false\" school districts by looking for \"false\" as part of the school district name appearing in Record Type C. \nA few additional exceptions occur where the Department of Defense operates elementary schools within a unified school district.\n\nThe TIGER/Line files store the school district codes in a set of three, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters.

Each CD is to be as equal in population to all other CDs in the state as practicable. The CDs of the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. These CD boundaries and numbers will remain in effect until after Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting had required a change. Six states were redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia).",

The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in conjunction with the 1970 census. Each school district is assigned a five-digit code that is unique within state. School district codes are assigned by the Department of Education and are not necessarily in alphabetical order by school district name.\n\nThe program identified three possible levels of school districts representing different segments of the school-age population (elementary, intermediate, and secondary) and a unified category to identify those school districts that represented all grade levels. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary levels of a school district may overlap each other because they represent different segments of the school-age population; for example, an intermediate school district could cover parts of several elementary school districts. The 1995 TIGER files use separate fields to accommodate for the overlap and may not contain a code for all grade levels.\n\nThe 1995 TIGER files contain a unified school district code for those school districts where all levels are represented in a single district. The elementary, intermediate, and secondary school district code fields are blank if there is a unified school district code.\n\nSchool districts may cut through existing census blocks. In such instances, the Census Bureau created new complete chains and GT polygons. However, the school district boundaries did not create new blocks. The tabulation blocks may contain more than one polygon, and each polygon may have a different school district code. The block parts/polygons allocated to the different school districts do not have separate tabulation block numbers. Thus, a school district in the TIGER files is a representation of the area, not the actual area. The 1995 TIGER files store the school district codes in a set of four, 5-character fields. All codes consist of numeric characters. The value, 9999, is a pseudo-school district code assigned to non-water blocks for which the National School District Program does not report a school district. Some large water areas have a pseudo-school district code of 99998.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Key Geographic Locations (KGLs), as defined by the US Census Bureau, throughout the state. Essential attribute data included are KGL Name and Census Feature Class Code (CFCC). Predominant features represented in this layer include: Airports or airfields; Custodial Facility (hospital, orphanage, Federal penitentiary, state prison); Educational or Religious Institution (convent or monastery, educational institution, religious institution); Multihousehold or Transient Quarters (apartment buildings and complexes, trailer courts or mobile home parks, campground, hotels, motels); Shopping centers or major retail centers; Transportation Terminal (train station, bus or marine terminal).\n\nPlease note that many other feature types may be present in this layer. Key geographic locations (KGLs) represent a special class of address information. They provide a geocoding tool like address ranges, but also identify a spatial object similar to a landmark. The Census Bureau uses KGLs to identify named buildings where the use of the feature name enhances the ability to geocode addresses. These cases include airports, shopping centers, schools, condominiums, hotels, and apartment complexes. Even though the KGLs appear to identify specific structures, the KGL descriptions do not include location coordinates. In most cases, the Census Bureau can determine the general location of the KGL, but cannot provide a specific location with any certainty.\n\nThe Census Bureau includes landmarks in the Census TIGER data base for locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau added landmark features on an as-needed-basis and made no attempt to ensure that all instances of a particular feature were included. The absence of a landmark does not mean that the living quarters, e.g., hospitals and group quarters associated with the landmark were excluded from the 1990 enumeration.\n\n A landmark can be a point, line, or area type. In some cases, the Census TIGER data base permits a choice of types. For instance, an airport or airfield might appear as a point, line, or area; the approach depends on the size of the feature and the depiction of the feature in the source document. Line features such as airfields could appear as one or more complete chains; they are not identified in the landmark record types\n\nA census feature class code (CFCC) is used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature. The CFCC is applied only once to a chain or landmark with preference given to classifications that cover features that are visible to an observer and a part of the ground transportation network. Thus, a road that also is the boundary of a town would have a CFCC describing its road characteristics, not its boundary characteristics. The CFCC, as used in the TIGER/Line files, is a three-character code. The first character is a letter describing the feature class; the second character is a number describing the major category; and the third character is a number describing the minor category.\n\nLandmark (Feature Class D) is the general name given to a cartographic (or locational) landmark, a land-use area, and a key geographic location. A cartographic landmark is identified for use by an enumerator while working in the field. A land-use area is identified in order to minimize enumeration efforts in uninhabited areas or areas where human access is restricted. A key geographic location is identified in order to more accurately geocode and enumerate a place of work or residence.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer depicts feature location and other associated data for American Indian tribal entities for those entities established on January 1, 2000.  American Indian Reservations are areas that have been set aside by the United States for the use of tribes, the exterior boundaries of which are more particularly defined in the final tribal treaties, agreements, executive orders, federal statutes, secretarial orders, or judicial determinations.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau recognizes federal reservations as territory over which American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority. These entities are known as colonies, communities, pueblos, rancherias, ranches, reservations, reserves, villages, Indian communities, and Indian villages. The Bureau of Indian Affairs maintains a list of federally recognized tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau contacts representatives of American Indian tribal governments to identify the boundaries for federal reservations. Federal reservations may cross state, county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The BIA supplied the U.S. Census Bureau with the names and exterior boundaries of the federal AIRs used for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for American Indian reservations in the 1970 census. The range of Census Codes allocated to Federal AIRs for the year 2000 data is 0001 to 4999.\nThere are both legal and statistical American Indian, Alaska Native, and native Hawaiian entities for which the U.S. Census Bureau provides data. The legal entities consist of federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, the tribal subdivisions that can divide these entities, state recognized American Indian reservations, Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs), and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs). Tribal subdivisions can exist within the statistical Oklahoma tribal statistical areas.\nIn all cases, these areas are mutually exclusive in that no American Indian, Alaska Native, or Hawaiian home land can overlap another tribal entity, except for tribal subdivisions, which subdivide some American Indian entities, and Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), which exist within Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs). \n\nAmerican Indian Trust Lands\nAreas for which the United States holds title in trust for the benefit of a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual Indian (individual trust land). Trust lands can be alienated or encumbered only by the owner with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior or his/her authorized representative. Trust lands may be located on or off a reservation. The U.S. Census Bureau recognizes and tabulates data for reservations and off-reservation trust lands because American Indian tribes have primary governmental authority over these lands. Primary tribal governmental authority generally is not attached to tribal lands located off the reservation until the lands are placed in trust. In U.S. Census Bureau data tabulations, off-reservation trust lands always are associated with a specific federally recognized reservation and/or tribal government. A tribal government appointed liaison provides the name and boundaries of their trust lands. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), an agency in the U.S. Department of the Interior, identified and provided maps of these areas for use by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1990 census. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for off-reservation tribal trust lands in the 1980 census; in 1990, the trust land data included both tribal and individual trust lands. The U.S. Census Bureau does not identify fee land (or land in fee simple status) or restricted fee lands as specific geographic categories and they are not identified in the TIGER/Line files. Trust lands are assigned the same code as the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands associated with tribes that do not have a reservation are assigned codes based on tribal name. In the TIGER/Line files, a letter code-\"T\" for tribal and \"I\" for individual-appears in a separate field and identifies off-reservation trust lands.\n\nAmerican Indian Reservations-State (State AIRs) \nReservations established by some state governments for tribes recognized by the state. A governor-appointed state liaison provides the names and boundaries for state recognized American Indian reservations to the U.S. Census Bureau. State reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to State AIRs for the year 2000 data is 9000 to 9499.\n\nAmerican Indian Tribal Subdivisions\nAdministrative subdivisions of federally recognized American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust land, or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). Tribal subdivisions are known as areas, chapters, communities, or districts. These entities are internal units of self-government or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic purposes for the American Indians on the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, or OTSAs. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundary and name information for tribal subdivisions from tribal governments. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in 1980 when it identified them as \"American Indian sub-reservation areas.\" The U.S. Census Bureau did not provide data for American Indian tribal subdivisions in conjunction with the 1990 census.\n\nJoint Use Areas\nAs applied to any American Indian area/Alaska Native area by the U.S. Census Bureau, means an area that is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The U.S. Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.\n\nState Designated American Indian Statistical Areas (SDAISAs)\nStatistical entities for state recognized American Indian tribes that do not have a state recognized land base (reservation). SDAISAs are identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by a state liaison identified by the governor's office in each state. SDAISAs generally encompass a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of people who identify with a state recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A SDAISA may not be located in more than one state unless the tribe is recognized by both states, and it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), tribal designated statistical area (TDSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau established SDAISAs as a new geographic statistical area for Census 2000 to differentiate between state recognized tribes without a land base and federally recognized tribes without a land base. For the 1990 census, all such tribal entities had been identified as TDSAs. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to SDAISAs for the year 2000 data is 9500 to 9998.\n\nTribal Designated Statistical Areas (TDSAs)\nStatistical entities identified and delineated for the U.S. Census Bureau by federally recognized American Indian tribes that do not currently have a federally recognized land base (reservation or off-reservation trust land). A TDSA generally encompasses a compact and contiguous area that contains a concentration of individuals who identify with a federally recognized American Indian tribe and in which there is structured or organized tribal activity. A TDSA may be located in more than one state, but it may not include area within an American Indian reservation, off-reservation trust land, Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), or Oklahoma tribal statistical area (OTSA). The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for TDSAs in conjunction with the 1990 census, when both federally and state recognized tribes could identify and delineate TDSAs. For Census 2000, TDSAs now apply only to federally recognized tribes. State recognized tribes without a land base, including those that were TDSAs in 1990, are identified as state designated American Indian statistical areas (SDAISAs), a new geographic entity for Census 2000. The range of Census Class Codes allocated to TDSAs for the year 2000 data is 8000 to 8999.\n\nTribal Jurisdiction Statistical Areas (TJSAs)\n1990 statistical entities identified and delineated for the 1990 census to provide a geographic frame of reference for the presentation of statistical data. 1990 TJSA boundaries were required to follow census block boundaries and were based upon the boundaries of the former reservations of federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma. TJSAs replaced the Historic Areas of Oklahoma recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1980 decennial census. The 1990 descriptive designation, TJSA, has been changed for Census 2000 to Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs).",

This dataset was recently revised by Wilbur Smith Associates, working with various staff within the Transportation Planning Division (TPD) and the GIS Division at ARC.  This Theme was created in ArcInfo using a variety of hardcopy sources from ARC's local governments for \"heads up\" digitizing against the 1999 digital orthophoto quarter quad (DOQQ) imagery.  Various features (arcs), representing on-street bike/ped trails and projects, were selected from GDOT's DLGF street centerline file, the primary contributing source to the new Atlanta Region Streets Theme (STREETS).  Off-road bike/ped paths were approximated for both existing and proposed (future) trails using this same imagery and street base.  To identify the RTP (proposed) trails, use the STATUS field to classify and symbolize, or to query records with a value equal to \"future.\"  To identify existing trails, use the STATUS field for a value equal to \"existing.\" Please note, not all RTP Bike/Ped projects are necessarily represented in this Theme.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Census Tracts for the state. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts where no local participant existed or where a local or tribal government declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs).\n\nCensus tracts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. For American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam, the optimum size is 2,500 people. Counties and statistically equivalent entities with fewer than 1,500 people have a single census tract. Census tracts on American Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and special places must contain a minimum of 1,000 people. (Special places include correctional institutions, military installations, college campuses, workers' dormitories, hospitals, nursing homes, and group homes.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement, delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. \nCensus tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties (see TRIBAL CENSUS TRACTS). The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the Type A class roads thoughout the state.\nFeature Class A roads include: Primary roads with limited access (interstate highways, toll highways); Primary roads without limited access (US highways, some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns); regional and state highways state highways, Secondary and connecting roads (includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods); Local, neighborhood, and rural roads, city streets, and vehicular trails.\n\nAccording to the TIGER95 Data Dictionary, the definition of a divided highway has been the source of considerable discussion. Earlier specifications have defined a divided road as having, \"..opposing traffic lanes that are physically separated by a median strip no less than 70 feet wide in former GBF/DIME areas or no less than 200 feet wide in non-GBF/DIME areas.\" This definition caused confusion in the proper coding of interstates having narrow medians. To clarify the situation, the Census Bureau now uses the term divided to refer to a road with opposing traffic lanes separated by any size median, and separated to refer to lanes that are represented in the Census TIGER data base as two distinct complete chains. Earlier operations may have depicted widely separated lanes as a single line in the data base or created separate lines when the median was small, depending on the available source used during the update.\n\nRoad types possibly represented here are defined as follows:\n\n-Primary Highway With Limited Access (A1): Interstate highways and some toll highways are in this category and are distinguished by the presence of interchanges. These highways are accessed by way of ramps and have multiple lanes of traffic. The opposing traffic lanes are divided by a median strip. The TIGER/Line files may depict these opposing traffic lanes as two distinct lines in which case, the road is called separated.\n-Primary Road Without Limited Access (A2): This category includes nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways, but may include some state highways and county highways that connect cities and larger towns. A road in this category must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt). It has intersections with other roads, may be divided or undivided, and have multilane or single-lane characteristics.\n-Secondary and Connecting Road (A3): This category includes mostly state highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods. The roads in this category are smaller than roads in Category A2, must be hard-surface (concrete or asphalt), and are usually undivided with single-lane characteristics. These roads usually have a local name along with a route number and intersect with many other roads and driveways.\n-Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road (A4): A road in this category is used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and street that is not a thoroughfare belonging in categories A2 or A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route number. Scenic park roads, unimproved or unpaved roads,and industrial roads are included in this category. Most roads in the Nation are classified as A4 roads.\n-Vehicular Trail (A5): A road in this category is usable only by four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is found almost exclusively in very rural areas. Sometimes the road is called a fire road or logging road and may include an abandoned railroad grade where the tracks have been removed. Minor, unpaved roads usable by ordinary cars and trucks belong in category\n-Road with Special Characteristics (A6): This category includes roads, portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road that are parts of the vehicular highway system and that have separately identifiable characteristics.\n-Road as Other Thoroughfare (A7): A road in this category is not part of the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians, and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to road names.",

States participating in the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) may provide the U.S. Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs. The U.S. Census Bureau first reported data for VTDs in the 1980 census.\nEach VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county. The code \"ZZZZZZ\" identifies bodies of water for which no VTDs were identified. For a state or county that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, the codes fields are blank. Because the U.S. Census Bureau requires that VTDs follow boundaries of tabulation census blocks, participating states often show the boundaries of the VTDs they submit as conforming to tabulation census block boundaries. If requested by the participating state, the U.S. Census Bureau identifies the VTDs that represent an actual voting district with a Place Description Code of X. Where a participating state indicated that the VTD is a \"pseudo\" VTD, the Place Description Code is Z. Where a participating state did not indicate to the U.S. Census Bureau whether or not the VTD followed the actual boundaries of the VTD or is a pseudo-VTD the Place Description Code is blank.\nThe following states did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs appear for these states: California; Florida; Kentucky; and Montana\nOf the participating states (or statistically equivalent entities), the following did not submit VTD boundaries or codes as part of Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program, but submitted State Legislative Districts (SLDs) only: North; Dakota; Ohio; Oregon; Wisconsin, and Arizona: did not submit VTDs in all counties.",

    "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) for the state. \n\nMSAs are Metropolitan Areas (MAs) that are not closely associated with other MAs. These areas typically are surrounded by non-metropolitan counties (county subdivisions in New England). There are three types of metropolitan areas. If a metropolitan area has a total population of less than 1,000,000, the area is designated a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Metropolitan areas with a population of 1,000,000 or greater qualify for designation as a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) that is composed of smaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs). This designation is not automatic; the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) solicits local opinion to designate CMSAs and their component PMSAs.\n\n\nPMSAs consist of a county or cluster of counties (cities and towns in New England) that demonstrate very strong internal economic and social links, in addition to close ties to other portions of the larger area. When PMSAs are established, the larger MA of which they are component parts is designated a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA). CMSAs and PMSAs are established only where local governments favor such a designation for a large MA.\n\nMetropolitan Areas (MAs) are designated and defined by the OMB, following a set of official standards that are published in a Federal Register Notice. These standards were developed by the interagency Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee, with the aim of producing definitions that are as consistent as possible for all MAs nationwide. The general concept of an MA is one of a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with that nucleus. Some MAs are defined around two or more nuclei. Each MA must contain either a place with a minimum population of 50,000 or a U.S. Census Bureau defined urbanized area and a total MA population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). An MA contains one or more central counties and may include one or more outlying counties that have close economic and social relationships with the central county. An outlying county must have a specified level of commuting to the central counties and also must meet certain standards regarding metropolitan character, such as population density, urban population, and population growth. In New England, MAs consist of cities and towns rather than whole counties. The territory, population, and housing units in MAs are referred to as \"metropolitan.\" The metropolitan category is subdivided into \"inside central city\" and \"outside central city.\" The territory, population, and housing units located outside MAs are referred to as \"non-metropolitan.\" The metropolitan and non-metropolitan classification cuts across the other hierarchies; for example, there is generally both urban and rural territory within both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.\n\nStatistical entities which share some relation to the MSA include:\n\nCentral City\nIn each metropolitan statistical area and consolidated metropolitan statistical area, the largest place and, in some cases, one or more additional places are designated as ''central cities'' under the official standards. A few primary metropolitan statistical areas do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities, are included in the title of the metropolitan area (MA); there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nMetropolitan Area Central Cities\nsmaller Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) do not have central cities. The largest central city and, in some cases, up to two additional central cities are included in the title of the MA; there also are central cities that are not included in an MA title. An MA central city does not include any part of that place that extends outside the MA boundary.\n\nNew England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs)\nNew England county metropolitan areas (NECMAs) are defined as a county-based alternative to the city and town based New England MSAs and CMSAs. The NECMA defined for an MSA or CMSA includes:\n- The county containing the first-named city in that MSA/CMSA title (this county may include the first-named cities of other MSAs/CMSAs as well.\n- Each additional county having at least half its population in the MSAs/CMSAs whose first-named cities are in the previously identified county.\nNECMAs are not identified for individual PMSAs. Only the CMSAs, MSAs, and PMSAs appear in the TIGER/Line files. The U.S. Census Bureau does not include NECMAs in the TIGER/Line files.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  The American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile includes the following legal entities: federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, State-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs).  The statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs).  Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile and mean that the area is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes.  The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data.  Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian / Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how the fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy.  The 2010 Census boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2010, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provided the legal boundaries used in Census 2000 for the HHLs, but provided no updates since and none for the 2010 Census although there is strong evidence of HHL land acquisitions and large housing and commercial development on most HHLs.  The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2010 Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments.  The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized Tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the Tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or when another Tribal, State, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land.  The boundaries for State recognized American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated State governor appointed liaisons for the 2010 Census through the State American Indian Reservation Program and TSAP respectively.",

    "dc_description_s": "The Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) datalayers provide digital polygon and line boundaries for areas that have been designated ACECs by the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA).  ACECs are places in Massachusetts that receive special recognition because of the quality, uniqueness and significance of their natural and cultural resources.  These areas are identified and nominated at the community level and are reviewed and designated by the state�s EEA Secretary.  ACEC designation creates a framework for local and regional stewardship of these critical resource areas and ecosystems.  ACEC designation also requires stricter environmental review of certain kinds of proposed development under state jurisdiction within the ACEC boundaries.\n\nThe ACEC Program is administered by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) on behalf of the Secretary of Environmental Affairs.  The Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Office administered the original Coastal ACEC Program from 1978 to 1993, and continues to play a key role in managing coastal ACECs.  Procedures for ACEC designation and the general policies governing the effects of designation are contained in the ACEC regulations (301 CMR 12.00).  For more information about the ACEC datalayer or about the effects of ACEC designation, contact the ACEC Program at (617) 626-1394 or see http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/acec/acecProgram.htm.\n\nThe ACEC datalayers have been compiled by CZM and DCR and include both coastal and inland areas. For more information on ACEC maps and boundaries, see http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/acec/aboutMaps.htm. To view the map index sheet of detailed ACEC maps (USGS topographic maps with ACEC boundaries), visit http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/acec/statewideMap.pdf and to view the individual map tiles see the links on the individual ACEC Designation web pages, http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/acec/acecs.htm. New ACEC polygons (and corresponding boundary lines) are added periodically, as new ACEC nominations are reviewed and designated on an ongoing basis. New nominations and designations are noticed in the EEA Environmental Monitor.\n\nAs of April, 2009 there are coded boundary arcs available for 10 of the 30 ACECs, part of an ongoing datalayer update program begun in 2003. These coded boundaries indicate what features are used for various ACEC boundary line segments, such as roads, town lines, or wetlands resource areas. The other 20 ACECs do not yet have individually coded arcs, but are shown in the line layer with arcs coded �NOT DEFINED.� Boundaries are also periodically clarified for better agreement with new GIS datalayers � designated boundaries do not change, but the accuracy with which they are described and mapped is improved. Discrepancies are more obvious with older boundaries, and at this time the 2008 Three Mile River Watershed ACEC boundary does not align with the adjacent 1990 Hockomock Swamp and 1991 Canoe River Aquifer ACECs which need to be clarified.\n\nTHIS DATALAYER IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND WITH THE WRITTEN BOUNDARY DESCRIPTIONS CONTAINED IN EACH ACEC DESIGNATION DOCUMENT. The mapped boundary is not to be used by itself for definitive ACEC boundary delineation or regulatory interpretation. For review of site-specific projects within the ACEC boundary, determinations may need to be made in the field or in consultation with ACEC Program staff.\n\nThese datalayers are stored in ArcSDE and distributed as ACECS_POLY and ACECS_ARC.",
