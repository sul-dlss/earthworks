    "This polygon shapefile contains the boundaries of 12 arrondissements in Paris, France, as represented in Philibert Vasserot's Atlas of Paris (1810-1836). This layer covers the whole of Paris (including the Seine) up to the boundary of the Farmers General.",
    "The ALPAGE programme aims to provide collaborative tools for the Humanities and Social Sciences and for Information Communication Technology (ICT) allowing for the development of research about the Parisian urban area. This aim is achieved by means of a GIS that includes cadastral and historical layers.",
